# Day Planner README

This application enables a user to enter tasks for each hour of a given day with the current date listed at the top of the page. All entered tasks are stored in local storage so a user may navigate away from the page and revisit their tasks later on. All tasks are colour-coded according to when they are scheduled as follows:
* Green - Tasks are due later in the day
* Grey - Tasks are passed due
* Red - Tasks are in the current hour

Here is a link to the current application: https://ayfor.github.io/day_scheduler/
